# Lux-Project
This Project was made with an Arduino UNO to pilot ws2812b leds.
I Used a KY-038 to detect sound coming through speakers to make the light flow to the music !
Finally i had a HC-05 to be able to control my leds with multiple modes on my phone via bluetooth.

I'll detail how to run the project when i upload it..
